Guessing Game is a Fullstack Academy Foundations Course project. It generates a random number between 1-100. Users can submit one guess at each time and the program will tell you how close you are to that number by giving you a temperature indication where "cold" means far and "hot" means close. Site background changes based on your guess temperature. You can play the game <a href="http://tmrvivian.github.io/GuessingGame/">here</a>.
